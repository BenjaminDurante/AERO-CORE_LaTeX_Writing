abstract = {Conventional controls, such as anoptimal control with a notch filter, are ableto remove the flutter instability under subsonic flows but may need higher adaptability to make the controllers stable under transonic flows with oscillating shocks, especially for the wing model with parameter uncertainties. Inthis paper,anerror-based control law designed via the active disturbancerejection control algorithmis proposed for the transonicflutter suppressionofawing model with parameter uncertainties and measurement noises taken into account. With the proposed control law, the observed output signal and its time derivative, the unmodeled dynamics, and the measurement noises are consistently estimated. The observed output signal and its time derivative are used to design a feedback control law for adjusting the output errors, whereas the observed unmodeled dynamics and the measurement noises are used to guarantee the adaptability and anti-interference of the proposed controller. To demonstrate the control performances, the wing of benchmark active control technologyis studied for the transonic flutter suppression. The numerical results show that the present control law can effectively suppress the transonic flutter at a wide range of Mach numbers and has noticeable adaptability to the variation in stiffness parameters.},

@article{A12Huang2019,
abstract = {In order to solve the problems of filtering divergence and low accuracy in Kalman filter (KF) applications in a high-speed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), this paper proposed a new method of integrated robust adaptive Kalman filter: strong adaptive Kalman filter (SAKF). The simulation of two high-dynamic conditions and a practical experiment were designed to verify the new multi-sensor data fusion algorithm. Then the performance of the Sage–Husa adaptive Kalman filter (SHAKF), strong tracking filter (STF), H∞ filter and SAKF were compared. The results of the simulation and practical experiments show that the SAKF can automatically select its filtering process under different conditions, according to an anomaly criterion. SAKF combines the advantages of SHAKF, H∞ filter and STF, and has the characteristics of high accuracy, robustness and good tracking skill. The research has proved that SAKF is more appropriate in high-speed UAV navigation than single filter algorithms.},

This framework allows stabilization and control with multiple command options, from body rate control to waypoint guidance. Also, pilot commands can be used to operate the simulation in a pilot-in-the-loop environment. This control system framework is created by using direct vehicle state feedback with nonlinear dynamic inversion. A direct control allocation scheme is used to command aircraft effectors. Online $\beta$-matrix estimation is used in the control allocation algorithm for maximum algorithm flexibility. Primary uses for this framework include conceptual design and early preliminary design of aircraft, where vehicle models change rapidly and a knowledge of vehicle six-degree-of-freedom performance is required. A simulated airbreathing hypersonic vehicle and a simulated high performance fighter are controlled to demonstrate the flexibility and utility of the control system.},

@article{A42Sieberling2010,
	abstract = {This paper presents a flight control strategy based on nonlinear dynamic inversion. The approach presented, called incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion, uses properties of general mechanical systems and nonlinear dynamic inversion by feeding back angular accelerations. Theoretically, feedback of angular accelerations eliminates sensitivity to model mismatch, greatly increasing the robust performance of the system compared with conventional nonlinear dynamic inversion. However, angular accelerations are not readily available. Furthermore, it is shown that angular acceleration feedback is sensitive to sensor measurement time delays. Therefore, a linear predictive filter is proposed that predicts the angular accelerations, solving the time delay and angular acceleration availability problem. The predictive filter uses only references and measurements of angular rates. Hence, the proposed control method makes incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion practically available using conventional inertial measurement units.

	abstract = {The F-35 program will replace a number of aging fighter inventories and enhance others for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, as well as the inventories of partner/allied countries. Although the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C have similar planforms and mission systems and share many common components, from a flight control system development perspective, they are quite unique. A novel approach to both control law design and software development was required to efficiently develop the control laws for three versions and ensure that the program met its demanding requirements. The use of nonlinear dynamic inversion as a viable control law methodology has been demonstrated on various flight control research platforms. However, the F-35 is the first production fighter to incorporate a dynamic inversion control law that operates from zero airspeed to supersonic speeds, controls the jet well beyond stall angle of attack, and provides exceptional flying qualities for operational tasks, ranging from short takeoff and vertical landing operations on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ships and large-deck carrier operations to basic fighter maneuvers. In addition, the F-35 control law software was developed based on a graphical model and auto-generated code. This was a key enabler to support software development for three F-35 versions, but it required a paradigm shift in the software development process at Lockheed Martin. This paper explores the in-depth effort of implementing a model-based control law methodology using dynamic inversion. It also provides an overview of the software development process used for F-35 flight control laws.},

@article{A100Candel2004,
	abstract = {Commercial high-speed flight at supersonic speeds poses major technological challenges that were resolved during the 1960s and early 1970s and that led to a unique vehicle in the history of air transportation. The demonstration of sustained supersonic flight has been made on a regular basis by operating the Concorde over a period of more than a quarter of a century. It has also served to show the limitations of this remarkable aircraft. Commercial operation of Concorde ceased in 2003. It is timely to look back at this adventure and review how this aircraft evolved from a project to a vehicle, identify some of the lessons learned from this experience, and possibly dwell on these lessons for future development of a new supersonic aircraft program. From this viewpoint, it has become clear that no new supersonic transport could be designed without first breaking many fundamental and technical barriers. A new project will benefit from the modern tools devised by aeronautical science and technology during the last period, but advances will have to be made to resolve many difficult challenges. The main areas of progress are related to the environmental impact of the vehicle, to its global performance, and to operational considerations. Meeting the challenges will require fundamental progress in aerodynamic optimization for sonic boom and drag reduction, combustion management for emission reduction, engine design to comply with noise regulations, and propulsion integration to improve performance. The environmental impact of a fleet of supersonic airliners will have to be carefully evaluated and compared to that of an all subsonic air transportation system.},

The aircraft of interest is a research-focused Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (R-UAV), a 1/16th scaled model of a concept supersonic business jet. Evaluation of stability and control characteristics is made based on a linearized time-invariant state-space small-perturbations approach over a range of angles of attack. Low-speed wind tunnel results together with unsteady aerodynamic panel method analysis are the basis for the aerodynamic stability derivatives used. The main goal of this work is to study the effects on stability and controllability of reduction in size (or complete elimination) of tail surfaces, with particular emphasis on the vertical tail.},

	abstract = {A small-scale supersonic flight experiment vehicle (OWASHI) is being developed at Muroran Institute of Technology as a flying testbed for verification of innovative technologies for high speed atmospheric flights which are essential to next-generation aerospace transportation systems. The second-generation configuration M2011 of the vehicle with a single Air Turbo Ramjet Gas-generator-cycle (ATR-GG) engine has been proposed. Its transonic thrust margin has been predicted to be insufficient, therefore drag reduction in the transonic regime is quite crucial for attainability of supersonic flights. In this study, we propose configuration modifications for drag reduction on the basis of the so-called area rule, and assess their effects through wave drag analysis, wind tunnel tests, and CFD analysis. As a result, the area-rule-based configurations have less drag than the baseline configuration M2011. However, the effects of the proposed bottleneck on the fuselage below the main wing are smaller than predicted. It would be caused by the drag due to separation and shocks around the bottleneck. It is necessary to redesign the area-rule-based bottleneck to be smoother.},

The AIS, being developed by Atlantis Research Labs, is based on the work of Eugene Gluhareff. Since Gluhareff's pressure jet design was originally intended for tip propulsion of helicopter rotor blades, it has been modified to work with a ramjet engine. The AIS utilizes three inlet stages where an under-expanded fuel jet is injected to draw in ambient air, producing a high velocity reactive mixture. Deceleration in a supersonic diffuser results in a high stagnation pressure gas mixture entering the combustion chamber. A method for the prediction of downstream mixture properties and resulting engine performance is derived for both static and dynamic operation. Performance is assessed in terms of specific impulse. The prediction models are validated against numerical simulations that replicate flow conditions associated with the AIS. Means of entrainment are studied through an analysis of the numerical simulation results.},

In addition, the range and nominal values of these parameters, which were included in the Mission Data Load, are presented. Once updates were made, the nominal pre-flight trajectory and Monte Carlo statistical results were determined and stress tests were performed to ensure system robustness.

The simulators examined cover a wide spectrum of vehicles including unmanned aerial vehicles, both full scale and micro size; unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles; and unmanned ground vehicles. The majority of simulators use simple numerical simulation and simplistic visualization using custom OpenGL code. An emerging trend is to used modified commercial game engines for physical simulation and visualization. The game engines that are commercially available today are capable of physical simulations providing basic physical properties and interactions between objects. Newer and/or specialized engines such as the flight simulator X-Plane or Ageia FhysX and Havok physics engines, are capable of simulating more complex physical interactions between objects. Researchers in need of a simulator have a choice of using game engines or available open source and commercially available simulators, allowing resources to be focused on research instead of building a new simulator.

@article{A148Krotov2005,
	abstract = {It is well known that among the first motivations for modern control theory were dynamic optimization problems in rocket launching and navigation in aerospace. These problems had become especially important in the 1940s and 1950s due to requirement to minimize various costly resources and design parameters, such as flight time, amount (mass) of fuel, weight of the spacecraft, the drag forces and other items. This had to be done under various restrictions on control capacities and other complicating factors, such for example, as incomplete information on the system. Among the precious techniques of applied mathematics there had long been developed an adequate tool for such problems which is the Calculus of Variations. Problems in flight dynamics had become the earliest serious technical object for its application. A large number of new basic ideas for adapting Calculus of Variations to modern control problems and synthesizing them into modern control theory were elaborated in the course of investigations in flight dynamics. This presentation traces some seminal investigations, which were crucial for related theoretical developments in former Soviet Union and present Russia and had also influenced related research beyond national borders. Such investigations had good historical precursors in the earlier mathematical works of P.L. Chebyshev, A.M. Lyapunov, A.A. Markov, the works in mechanics by N.E. Zhukovski and S.A. Chaplygin and the activities in dynamic systems theory of the 1930s (A.A. Andronov, L.S. Pontryagin, et al.). The present paper is confined only to deterministic problems in trajectory analysis, control and optimization within the framework of mathematical theory of controlled processes. The national community of researchers involved in these topics was enormous, including those in the Academy of Sciences, the Universities and the numerous institutions and plants supervised by related industrial ministries. While giving tribute to all those involved, this paper does not claim to give a full review of available publications, concentrating on what the authors believe to be the seminal issues in the field. This publication will therefore inevitably have a subjective flavor. We sincerely apologize to all those whose contributions may have been missed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The severe drag and aeroheating impacting these vehicles can be significantly reduced if the bow shock wave ahead of the vehicles forebodies is controlled to yield weaker system of oblique shocks. Benefits of forebody shock control include increasing flight ranges, economizing fuel consumption, reducing dead weights, and thermally protecting forebody structure and onboard equipment. Forebody shock control that has been widely studied since the early 1900s is achievable in numerous techniques that vary according to the mechanism of control. While some of these techniques have already been implemented in real systems, other techniques involve serious complications and tough trade-offs. The present paper is intended to serve as the first comprehensive survey on the field of forebody shock control devices. The objectives of the present paper are multifold. The paper categorizes the various forebody shock control devices in a physics-based manner, explains the underlying physics for each device, and surveys the key studies and state-of-the-art knowledge.

The interaction between the primary nozzle flow and the secondary jet is examined using experiments and numerical simulations. The relationships between FTV parameters [nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) and secondary jet pressure ratio (SPR)] and FTV performance (thrust pitching angle and thrust pitching moment) are investigated. The experiments are conducted with an NPR of up to 10 and an SPR of up to 2.7. Numerical simulations of the nozzle flow are performed using a Navier-Stokes solver with input parameters set to match the experimental conditions. The thrust pitching angle and moment computed from the force-moment balance are used to evaluate FTV performance. The experiment and numerical results indicate that the FTV parameters (NPR and SPR) directly affect FTV performance. Conventionally, FTV performance evaluated by the common method using thrust pitching angle is highly dependent on the location of evaluation. Hence, in this study, we show that the thrust pitching moment, a parameter which is independent of the location, is the appropriate figure of merit to evaluate the performance of FTV systems.},

@article{A164Russell2020,
	abstract = {Research interest has been growing in recent years in supersonic transport, particularly supersonic propulsion systems. A key component of a commonly studied propulsion system, ramjets, is the air intake. For supersonic propulsion systems a major factor in the overall efficiency is the intake pressure recovery. This refers to the ratio of the average total pressure after the intake to that of the freestream. One phenomenon that can have a large effect on this performance index is flow separation at the inlet. The aim of this work is to examine how pulsed laser energy deposition can be used to improve pressure recovery performance by reducing flow separation at the inlet. This research examines the effects of pulsed laser energy deposition upstream of an intake with an axisymmetric centrebody in a Mach 1.92 indraft wind tunnel. Laser frequency was varied between 1 and 60 kHz with an energy per pulse of 5.6 mJ. Schlieren photography was used to examine the fundamental fluid dynamics while total and static pressure downstream of the intake diffuser were measured to examine the resulting effect on the performance. Schlieren imaging shows that the interaction between the laser generated thermal bubble and the leading edge shock produced by the centrebody results in a significant reduction in separation along the intake cone. Analysis of the schlieren results and the pressure results in tandem illustrate that the average separation location along the length of the centrebody directly correlates to the pressure recovery observed in the intake. At the optimal laser frequency, found for this Mach number to be 10 kHz, the pressure recovery is found to increase by up to 4.7{\%}. When the laser power added to the system is considered, this results in an overall increase in propulsive power of 2.47{\%}.},

	abstract = {Low order equivalent system (LOES) models for the Tu-144 supersonic transport aircraft were identified from flight test data. The mathematical models were given in terms of transfer functions with a time delay by the military standard MIL-STD-1797A, “Flying Qualities of Piloted Aircraft,” and the handling qualities were predicted from the estimated transfer function coefficients. The coefficients and the time delay in the transfer functions were estimated using a nonlinear equation error formulation in the frequency domain. Flight test data from pitch, roll, and yaw frequency sweeps at various flight conditions were used for parameter estimation. Flight test results are presented in terms of the estimated parameter values, their standard errors, and output fits in the time domain. Data from doublet maneuvers at the same flight conditions were used to assess the predictive capabilities of the identified models. The identified transfer function models fit the measured data well and demonstrated good prediction capabilities. The Tu-144 was predicted to be between level 2 and 3 for all longitudinal maneuvers and level 1 for all lateral maneuvers. High estimates of the equivalent time delay in the transfer function model caused the poor longitudinal rating. iii},

In order to optimize the aerodynamic performance across the full flight envelope a fully integrated flight and propulsion control system will be required. However, this will need to be designed from the outset within clearly defined flight control and performance guidelines. Relevant existing and AST specific handling qualities criteria will need to be developed if a successful commercial transport aircraft is to be produced. This paper begins by presenting an overview of existing supersonic transport (SST) aircraft operations and current second generation SST research activities and design considerations. This is followed by an analysis of the principal aerodynamic, dynamic and control characteristics of SST and AST aircraft and their effect on the aircraft's handling qualities.

The external environment of the aircraft and the access to the aerodynamic parameters all lead to large disturbances in the aerodynamic parameters. The control strategy of this paper focuses on this kind of disturbance. Firstly, the original six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model is analyzed and simplified, and the model with strict feedback form is obtained. Then a neural network adaptive control law is designed based on the Backstepping method. The control law uses a neural network to estimate the uncertainty of the aerodynamic parameters and compensate for it. In order to solve the problem of difficult calculation of Backstepping method, this paper deduces a simple calculation formula. Finally, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the attitude angle tracking error is locally ultimately bounded. Simulation results show that the control strategy, in the presence of aerodynamic parameters perturbations and external disturbances, has good tracking performance and strong robustness.},

The feedback linearization is based on the full rotational equations of motion rather than on a conventional model derived from time-scale separation. Input and state constraints are applied to avoid input saturations, to guarantee a minimum level of tracking performance, and to avoid physical vehicle state constraints violation. A constraint mapping algorithm is developed to map the input and state constraints on the new inputs after feedback linearization. The performance of the constrained model predictive control design is compared with that of two PID control designs. Simulation of a complete entry flight demonstrates the advantages of the constrained model predictive control design, because control surfaces do not saturate, control actions are more smooth and efficient, no gain scheduling is required, and all performance requirements are satisfied.

The importance of UAS in scientific applications has been thoroughly demonstrated in recent years (DoD, 2010). Whatever missions are chosen for the UAS, their number and use will significantly increase in the future. UAS today play an increasing role in many public missions such as border surveillance, wildlife surveys, military training, weather monitoring, and local law enforcement. Challenges such as the lack of an on-board pilot to see and avoid other aircraft and the wide variation in unmanned aircraft missions and capabilities must be addressed in order to fully integrate UAS operations in the NAS in the Next Gen time frame. UAVs are better suited for dull, dirty, or dangerous missions than manned aircraft. UAS are mainly used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), border security, counter insurgency, attack and strike, target identification and designation, communications relay, electronic attack, law enforcement and security applications, environmental monitoring and agriculture, remote sensing, aerial mapping and meteorology.

Surface pressure measurements, schlieren visualization, discharge voltage and current measurements, and plasma imaging with a high-speed camera were used to evaluate the plasma control authority on the ramp pressure distribution. The plasma being generated in front of the compression ramp shifted the shock position from the ramp corner to the electrode location, forming a flow separation zone ahead of the ramp. It was found that the pressure on the compression surface reduced almost linearly with the plasma power. The ratio of pressure change to flow stagnation pressure was also an increasing function of the ratio of plasma power to enthalpy flux, indicating that the task-related plasma control effectiveness ranged from 17.5 to 25.},

Fine flow structures are obtained via nano-tracer planar laser scattering (NPLS) technique, typical flow structures such as boundary layer, shear layer, and shock wave are visible distinctly. The angle of shock wave and the development of boundary layer are measured by time-averaged flow field, the spatiotemporal evolutions of flow field are revealed by two time-dependent NPLS images. Results indicate that when ramp angles are 25°, a typical separation occurs in laminar flow, and a certain extent separation occurs in transitional flow, while separation does not occur in turbulent flow. When ramp angles are 28°, laminar flow separates further, a typical separation occurs in transitional flow, by comparison, separation region in turbulent flow is small. Significant differences of the three types of ramp flows can be found in shock wave structure and flow separation. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

	abstract = {While balloon launch is one of the most cost-efficient ways to realize a supersonic flight experiment, it presents some issues for the controller. D-SEND{\#}2 is one flight experiment of this kind which was carried out in 2015. An unpowered test vehicle was lifted to an altitude of 30 km by a balloon and then released. After separation, the vehicle's onboard flight control computer selected a target Boom Measurement System (BMS) according to the separation point. The vehicle then autonomously flew to the BMS selected and established the prescribed sonic boom measurement flight conditions. The design of the guidance, navigation, and control system for the D-SEND{\#}2 flight test was exceptionally challenging, and it was solved by a combination of a sophisticated guidance law and a control law based on dynamic inversion and time scale separation. This paper describes a controller design method for a balloon-launch flight experiment and applied it to a D-SEND{\#}2 control system design. Flight results are presented to show the effectiveness of the controller design method.},

	abstract = {Four flights have been conducted using the Tu-144LL supersonic transport aircraft with the dedicated objective of collecting quantitative data and qualitative pilot comments. These data are compared with the following longitudinal flying qualities criteria: Neal-Smith, short-period damping, time delay, control anticipation parameter, phase delay (??sp*T??2), pitch bandwidth as a function of time delay, and flightpath as a function of pitch bandwidth. Determining the applicability of these criteria and gaining insight into the flying qualities of a large, supersonic aircraft are attempted. Where appropriate, YF-12, XB-70, and SR-71 pilot ratings are compared with the Tu-144LL results to aid in the interpretation of the Tu-144LL data and to gain insight into the application of criteria. The data show that approach and landing requirements appear to be applicable to the precision flightpath control required for up-and-away flight of large, supersonic aircraft. The Neal-Smith, control anticipation parameter, and pitch-bandwidth criteria tend to correlate with the pilot comments better than the phase delay criterion, ??sp*T??2. The data indicate that the detrimental flying qualities implication of decoupled pitch-attitude and flightpath responses occurring for high-speed flight may be mitigated by requiring the pilot to close the loop on flightpath or vertical speed.},

abstract = {Multivariate-orthogonal-function modeling was applied to wind-tunnel databases for eight different aircraft to identify a generic global aerodynamic model structure that could be used for any of the aircraft. For each aircraft database and each nondimensional aerodynamic coefficient, global models were identified from multivariate polynomials in the nondimensional states and controls, using an orthogonalization procedure. A predicted-squareerror criterion was used to automatically select the model terms. Modeling terms selected in at least half of the analyses, which totaled 45 terms, were retained to form the generic global aerodynamic model structure. Least squares was used to estimate the model parameters and associated uncertainty that best fit the generic global aerodynamic model structure to each database. The result was a single generic aerodynamic model structure that could be used to accurately characterize the global aerodynamics for any of the eight aircraft, simply by changing the values of the model parameters. Nonlinear flight simulations were used to demonstrate that the generic global aerodynamic model accurately reproduces trim solutions, local dynamic behavior, and global dynamic behavior under large-amplitude excitation. This compact global aerodynamic model can decrease flight-computer memory requirements for implementing onboard fault detection or flight control systems, enable quick changes for conceptual aircraft models, and provide smooth analytical functional representations of the global aerodynamics for control and optimization applications. All information required to construct global aerodynamic models for nonlinear simulations of the eight aircraft is provided in this paper.},

The unsteady flow field was measured with integrated pressure sensors. Nonlinear aerodynamic effects due to shock dynamics and unsteady flow separation were investigated as they are a key problem in flutter analysis of wings with control surfaces at transonic airspeeds. For highest accuracy of the data an optical position measurement system was used to measure the motion of the model and the flap and their deformation under wind load. It turned out that the deformation under wind load cannot be neglected, but has to be taken into account when comparing the data to numerical simulations. The target therefore is to derive a simple structural model for the deformation and to get corrected data at every point of the test envelope.},

abstract = {A variable stability in-flight simulator has the capabilities to change the response of an aircraft in-flight, often without changing the physical properties of the aircraft. The ability to adjust the aircraft response characteristics and handling qualities has various purposes, such as pilot training, control system development, and handling quality research. A variable stability control system is designed for a medium-range business jet using incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion. The performance of the in-flight simulator is verified by two experiments, one conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator and one in a Cessna Citation II laboratory aircraft. The fly-by-wire actuation system in the Cessna Citation II is based on its existing autopilot, inheriting the limited performance and safety protections. The simulator experiment shows differences between the experienced handling qualities for a reference model and the designed controller combined with aircraft dynamics. These differences mainly arise due to actuator saturation for specific handling quality settings. The in-flight experiment supports the simulator findings but also reveals how the available control authority around the initial condition is limited due to constraints of the fly-by-wire system.},

Hierarchy-structured dynamic inversion is applied to the attitude control to accommodate a broad flight envelope. The post-flight evaluation results based on the telemetry data conclude that both the flight requirements and the mission requirements are satisfied and that the guidance and control law worked accurately as designed. However, they also conclude that there was a significant amount of error especially in the drag coefficient.

Due to the one-shot nature of the experiment, it was not sufficient to guarantee the stability of the test vehicle, but it was also necessary to achieve the mission objectives on the first flight. Accordingly, we performed an inclusive pre-flight evaluation of D–SEND#2 including the flight controller and operating conditions. This approach was very effective at enhancing the probability of mission success under off-design flight conditions.

abstract = {The very unusual F-117 configuration has an equally unusual combination of aerodynamic instabilities, cross axis coupling, and directionally destabilizing exhaust nozzle effects that posed some unique challenges to the design of the Flight Control System (FCS). Radar and infrared signature considerations dictated the highly swept wings, swept canted fins, and the high aspect ratio engine exhaust nozzles. Installing two large internal weapons bays, the engines, exhaust nozzles, mission avionics, and fuel tanks into the defined planform resulted in the center of gravity (CG) being relatively far aft. The aft CG was desirable because cruise trim drag and the radar signature were minimized with essentially zero elevon deflection. Aerodynamic instabilities within the desired operational flight envelope were deemed acceptable. Although the F-117 design mission was precision bombing at night, the customer wanted the aircraft to meet the maneuvering and flying qualities requirements of a Fighter/Attack aircraft. To safely meet these requirements, the FCS had to provide a high level of stability augmentation and have the control power authority through the two fins and the four elevons to prevent departures during large amplitude maneuvering. Consequently, a full authority Fly-By- Wire FCS originally developed for the F-16 was modified for use in the F-117. New control laws were designed to provide the good flying qualities of a classic conventional aircraft and to allow the F-117 to be rapidly and safely maneuvered within the permissible flight envelope. The FCS also required conventional auto pilot relief modes and automatic navigation so that the pilot could concentrate on the tactical situation during a mission. The first flight of the F-117 prototype took place in June 1981 thirty-one months after program go ahead in November 1978. Refinement of the FCS continued in parallel with the development testing of the weapon system avionics and allowed limited Introduction of Operational Capability (IOC) to be achieved in October of 1983. High Angle-Of-Attack flight testing was completed after IOC and the fully developed Flight Control Computer was retrofitted into the fleet starting in 1986. The use of streamlined project management and the close coordination of customer and contractor teams during design, simulator evaluations, Iron Bird testing, and flight testing allowed the FCS to be developed quickly and at a relatively low cost. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

abstract = {Modern civil transport aircraft utilise increasingly complex command and stability augmentation systems to restore stability, optimise aerodynamic performance and provide the pilot with the optimum handling qualities. Provided it has sufficient control power a second generation fly-by-wire supersonic transport aircraft should be capable of exhibiting similarly desirable low-speed handling qualities. However, successful flight control law design requires identification of the ideal command response type for a particular phase of flight, a set of valid handling quality design criteria and piloted simulation evaluation tasks and metrics. A non-linear mathematical model of the European supersonic transport aircraft has been synthesized on the final approach to land. Specific handling quality design criteria have been proposed to enable the non-linear dynamic inversion flight control laws to be designed, with piloted simulation used for validation. A pitch rate command system, with dynamics matched to the aircraft's flight path response, will consistently provide Level 1 handling qualities. Nevertheless, pre-filtering the pilot's input to provide a second order pitch rate response, using the author's suggested revised constraints on the control anticipation parameter will generate the best handling qualities during the terminal phase of flight. The resulting pre-filter can be easily applied to non-linear dynamic inversion inner loop controllers and has simple and flight proven sensor requirements.},

	abstract = {Trim defines conditions for both design and analysis based on aircraft models. In fact, we often define these analysis points more broadly than the conditions normally associated with trim conditions to facilitate that analysis or design. In simulations, these analysis points establish initial conditions comparable to flight conditions. Based on aerodynamic and propulsion systems models of an aircraft, trim analysis can be used to provide the data needed to define the operating envelope or the performance characteristics. Linear models are typically derived at trim points. Control systems are designed and evaluated at points defined by trim conditions. And these trim conditions provide us a starting point for comparing one model against another, one implementation of a model against another implementation of the same model, and the model to flight-derived data. In this paper we define what we mean by trim, examine a variety of trim conditions that have proved useful and derive the equations defining those trim conditions. Finally we present a general approach to trim through constrained minimization of a cost function based on the nonlinear, six-degree-of freedom state equations coupled with the aerodynamic and propulsion system models. We provide an example of how a trim algorithm is used with a simulation by showing an example from JSBSim.},

abstract = {The Abrupt Wing Stall (AWS) at moderate Angle-of-Attacks (AoA) and transonic flight conditions can result in uncommanded lateral motions such as heavy wing, wing drop and wing rock that degrade handling qualities, mission performance and safety of flight for the aircraft. This phenomenon caused by asymmetric wing flows makes it difficult to perform precision tracking or maneuvering in the transonic flight envelope. According to the previous research results, this substantial phenomenon has occurred in a large number of the fighter aircraft programs, typically at the early flight test development stage, and a lot of budgets and efforts are required through the development period of the aircraft. To compensate for this drawback, Free-To-Roll (FTR) wind tunnel test is adopted as a method to identify the uncommanded lateral motions of the aircraft and improve the flight characteristics at the configuration design stage. However, using only the existing control methods such as the feed-forward control methods as well as the configuration design can reduce limitedly the uncommanded lateral motion. Besides, the feedback control methods using optimal control, adaptive and neural network control which do not provide a deterministic solution are limited to obtain the airworthiness certification. This paper presents a new design approach in which uncommanded lateral motions of the aircraft can be reduced even more than the existing methods. That is the additional augmentation control method, using angular acceleration measurement, that improves the flight characteristics using a feedback control technique based on the Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI). To evaluate the performances of the proposed control method, we perform the frequency-domain linear analysis and time-domain numerical simulations based on the mathematical model of advanced trainer aircraft. The evaluation result reveals that the proposed control method reduces effectively uncommanded lateral motions and improves the handling qualities of the aircraft.},

	abstract = {This paper provides details on best practices for vehicle design for BVLOS missions, with a focus on robust control links and real-time health monitoring.The development work presented herein focuses on a specific mission to set the speed and distance world record for a fully autonomous vehicle, requiring development of analytic tools for estimating vehicle range and endurance, as well as models for predicting command and control link integrity while operating BVLOS. Range and endurance estimates are developed using a novel real-time system identification algorithm onboard the vehicle for aerodynamic parameter estimation, and propulsion system characterization. Flight-testing methods and results are presented demonstrating the capabilities of these algorithms, with results from a unique test-case involving an unintended fault during the record flight. In addition to the vehicle performance assessment, Friis-based models are introduced to provide a pseudo real-time communications link range assessment. The predictive communications range models were refined using specific antenna and system characterization data measured in a compact range facility resulting in a detailed link budget useful for addressing BVLOS command and control requirements. The combination of aircraft and radio-frequency performance prediction models with supporting flight-testing techniques applied to small unmanned aerial systems provides critical insight into the design of future vehicles, and validation of existing systems tasked with performing BVLOS missions.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach for improving the dynamic response of a bank-to-turn autopilot for a non-linear six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft model. The autopilot consists of a series of gain-scheduled (GS) proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controllers that govern the aircraft's angular velocities for roll, pitch and yaw. The controller gains have been optimised for localised trim points and applied continuously to the controllers using linear interpolation to form a hypersurface. Our novel solution has been achieved by implementing a set of scheduled gains for near-zero reference signals and integrating this with a set of gains that are normalised to the reference signal. The proposed approach has been compared to conventional gain scheduling techniques using a series of step input simulated manoeuvres, applied individually to the roll and pitch controllers. The results show improved rise and fall times, steady state errors, as well as reduced controller effort.},

abstract = {The Blended Wing Body (BWB) is a type of innovative aircraft, based on the flying wing concept. For this aircraft, the literature has reported performance improvements compared to conventional aircraft: economy of fuel, reduction of the weight of the structure, increased payload capacity and less impact on the environment. However, most BWB studies have focused on large aircraft and it is not sure whether the gains are the same for smaller aircraft. The main objective of this study is to perform the conceptual design of a 200 passengers BWB and compare its performance against an equivalent conventional A320 aircraft in terms of payload and range. Moreover, an emphasis will be placed on obtaining a stable aircraft, with the analysis of static and dynamic stability over its flight envelope. This kind of aircraft has a lack of stability due to the absence of vertical tail. Most studies of stability were already realized on reduced size models of BWB, but there is no study on a 200 passengers BWB. The design of the BWB was realized with the platform called Computerized Environment for Aircraft Synthesis and Integrated Optimization Methods (CEASIOM). The airplane, the engines and the control surfaces were obtained in the geometrical module AcBuilder. This design platform, suitable for conventional aircraft design, has been modified and additional tools have been integrated in order to achieve the aerodynamic, performance and stability analysis of the BWB aircraft. The aerodynamic coefficients are calculated from Tornado program. The BWB flight envelope was created based on aeronautical data of A320 aircraft. From this flight envelope, we have got back several thousand possible points of flight. The static and dynamic stability was studied using the longitudinal and lateral matrices of stability and the Flying Qualities Requirements for every flight point.},

The project is carried out in two phases (D-SEND#1 and D-SEND#2). The D-SEND#1 drop tests were conducted twice in May 2011. The two different axisymmetric bodies were dropped from the balloon at 30km altitude and the conventional N-type and the shaped sonic booms were successfully captured by microphones at multiple altitudes up to 1km. The D-SEND#2 is scheduled to be conducted in 2013 in the same way as the D-SEND#1. An unmanned experimental supersonic airplane based on the JAXA's low sonic boom design technology is newly designed. The sonic boom intensity of the airplane is designed to be almost as half as the conventional supersonic transport. The airplane autonomously flies over microphones and the shaped sonic booms are measured. In this paper, the balloon drop test method, the test bodies and the aerial sonic boom measurement system with blimps are described. Some test results of the D-SEND#1 are presented as well.},

In the program, aerodynamic design tools which combine a CFD code with an optimization technique for drag minimization is developed and applied to the design of the jet-powered scaled experimental airplane. The baseline configuration is designed through the conventional linear theory based approaches together with system requirements to determine the wing planform, the wing warp, and the complete aircraft configuration. Shape optimization is applied to nacelle and non-axisymmetrical fuselage design with the consideration of nacelle/airframe integration. The results indicate that installation interactions have little effect on the shape optimization the nacelle aft body surface, and it suggests that the nacelle afterbody surface can be independently designed from an isolated nacelle. Results also indicate that a non-axisymmetrical fuselage concept with the optimization is effective for the reduction of the pressure drag even if the equivalent area distribution of an initial configuration is far from that of the Shears-Haack body. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

The main objectives of the tests for the NEXST-1 airplane were to confirm the supersonic natural laminar flow (NLF) wing design based on a CFD inverse design method, to collect aerodynamic data on the supersonic separation from a rocket booster and to demonstrate the transition measurement method applied at flight test. All the tests have already been completed. The tests on the NEXST-2 airplane have been conducted since 2001. The main objectives of them are to validate our CFD design tool for a complicated configuration with propulsion system, to supply effective aerodynamic data to be used in the detailed system design phase. In addition, some wind tunnel tests on fundamental research activities such as a HLD performance improvement technology and a low boom design technology have been continued. According to those tests, first of all, we experimentally confirmed the NLF wing design concept and transition measurement method for the flight test. Then we obtained lots of effective aerodynamic data for the supersonic separation and the complicated configuration with two large engine nacelles. Furthermore, some tests on the HLD and sonic boom research activities have provided good aerodynamic data in advancing their technologies. {\textcopyright} 2002 by the author(s).

It was observed that small UAVs tend to exhibit higher natural frequencies of oscillation compared to larger aircraft. As a result, the small UAV configurations fell outside the range of acceptable handling qualities for short-period mode natural frequency, even though multiple test pilots rated the flying qualities as acceptable. Using dynamic scaling methods to adjust the current military standards for the short period mode, a new standard is proposed specifically for small UAVs.

A possible solution for the evaluation of handling qualities is based on the minimization of cumulative cross track error (estimated along a sequence of waypoints) at constant altitude and speed, assuming gradual variation of the control inputs (throttle, elevator and ailerons). A complete parametric analysis of vehicle open loop dynamics is performed for a demonstrative mini-UAV. The flying and handling qualities are assessed implementing the selected platform in a full state flight simulator including a realistic autonomous navigation and control system. Different target paths are considered and a parametric study based on the minimization of the cross track error is presented. A section of conclusions summarizes the key results and presents suggestions for future work. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index.

	abstract = {This paper describes the history, objectives, structure, and current capabilities of the Stanford University Unstructured (SU2) tool suite. This computational analysis and design software collection is being developed to solve complex, multi-physics analysis and optimization tasks using arbitrary unstructured meshes, and it has been designed so that it is easily extensible for the solution of Partial Differential Equation-based (PDE) problems not directly envisioned by the authors. At its core, SU2 is an open-source collection of C++ software tools to discretize and solve problems described by PDEs and is able to solve PDE-constrained optimization problems, including optimal shape design. Although the toolset has been designed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, it has also been extended to treat other sets of governing equations including potential flow, electrodynamics, chemically reacting flows, and several others. In our experience, capabilities for computational analysis and optimization have improved considerably over the past two decades. However, the ability to integrate the resulting software packages into coupled multi-physics analysis and design optimization solvers has remained a challenge: the variety of approaches chosen for the independent components of the overall problem (flow solvers, adjoint solvers, optimizers, shape parameterization, shape deformation, mesh adaption, mesh deformation, etc) make it difficult to (a) expand the range of applicability to situations not originally envisioned, and (b) to reduce the overall burden of creating integrated applications. By leveraging well-established object-oriented software architectures (using C++) and by enabling a common interface for all the necessary components, SU2 is able to remove these barriers for both the beginner and the seasoned analyst. In this paper we attempt to describe our efforts to develop SU2 as an integrated platform. In some senses, the paper can also be used as a software reference manual for those who might be interested in modifying it to suit their own needs. We carefully describe the C++ framework and object hierarchy, the sets of equations that can be currently modeled by SU2, the available choices for numerical discretization, and conclude with a set of relevant validation and verification test cases that are included with the SU2 distribution. We intend for SU2 to remain open source and to serve as a starting point for new capabilities not included in SU2 today, that will hopefully be contributed by users in both academic and industrial environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

	abstract = {Testing of untethered subscale models, often referred to as subscale flight testing, has traditionally had a relatively minor, yet relevant use in aeronautical research and development. As recent advances in electronics, rapid prototyping and unmanned-vehicle technologies expand its capabilities and lower its cost, this experimental method is seeing growing interest across academia and the industry. However, subscale models cannot meet all similarity conditions required for simulating full-scale flight. This leads to a variety of approaches to scaling and to other alternative applications. Through a literature review and analysis of different scaling strategies, this study presents an overall picture of how subscale flight testing has been used in recent years and synthesises its main issues and practical limitations. Results show that, while the estimation of full-scale characteristics is still an interesting application within certain flight conditions, subscale models are progressively taking a broader role as low-cost technology-testing platforms with relaxed similarity constraints. Different approaches to tackle the identified practical challenges, implemented both by the authors and by other organisations, are discussed and evaluated through flight experiments.},

abstract = {A bifilar (two-wire) pendulum is a torsional pendulum consisting of a test object suspended by two thin parallel wires. The pendulum oscillates about the vertical axis. The restoring torque of the bifilar pendulum is provided by the gravitational force as rotations from the rest state cause the test object to raise slightly. The mass moment of inertia is computed using dynamic modeling, measurements of the oscillation period, and the physical dimensions of the bifilar pendulum such as the length and separation displacement of the pendulum wires. A simulation technique is described that improves estimates of the mass moment of inertia by considering the nonlinear effects of damping and large angular displacements. An analysis of the error variance of mass moment of inertia measurements is also described. The resulting expression for the error variance is used to optimize the physical parameters of the bifilar pendulum to obtain the moment of inertia measurement with the minimum error variance. Monte Carlo simulations were used to validate the parameter optimization technique. Experimental results are presented for a uniform-density test object for which the moment of inertia is straightforward to compute from geometric considerations. Results are also presented for a small unmanned air vehicle, which was the intended application for this moment of inertia measurement technique.},

@article{A323Stocker2017,
	abstract = {UAVs-unmanned aerial vehicles-facilitate data acquisition at temporal and spatial scales that still remain unachievable for traditional remote sensing platforms. However, current legal frameworks that regulate UAVs present significant barriers to research and development. To highlight the importance, impact, and diversity of UAV regulations, this paper provides an exploratory investigation of UAV regulations on the global scale. For this, the methodological approach consists of a research synthesis of UAV regulations, including a thorough literature review and a comparative analysis of national regulatory frameworks. Similarities and contrasting elements in the various national UAV regulations are explored including their statuses from the perspectives of past, present, and future trends. Since the early 2000s, countries have gradually established national legal frameworks. Although all UAV regulations have one common goal-minimizing the risks to other airspace users and to both people and property on the ground-the results reveal distinct variations in all the compared variables. Furthermore, besides the clear presence of legal frameworks, market forces such as industry design standards and reliable information about UAVs as public goods are expected to shape future developments.},

	abstract = {Current design requirements are shaping advanced and efficient supersonic or hypersonic aircraft concepts, capable of flying between distant parts of the globe within hours, and making affordable and safe access-to-space transportation. To achieve this challenge, reliable design tools, like Computational Fluid Dynamics, are strongly integrated in multidisciplinary design procedures. In this framework, the present paper deals with the importance and capabilities of Computational Fluid Dynamics investigations, especially those involved in vehicle aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic appraisal, to support and feed the design of high-speed aircraft. At first the Computational Fluid Dynamics support in various phases of design is addressed. Furthermore, an overall vision on methodologies used in a high speed flow computation is also given, addressing advantages and drawbacks of classical methodologies versus modern hybrid RANS methods ones. Then, a brief overview on either numerical schemes and tools, routinely adopted in an hypersonic simulation, is presented with reference to the multi-scale accuracy required by high supersonic/hypersonic flow regime. Finally, to provide a complete template for future numerical experiments, several Computational Fluid Dynamics activities, performed for a number of high-speed aircraft in different flow regimes, ranging from subsonic up to hypersonic speed, are reported and discussed. Computational methodology, domain discretization, and the support to design activity are provided for the CIRA USV1 and USV3, ESA-IXV, HEXAFLY-INT, a space launcher, and a Mars entry capsule. These examples show that Computational Fluid Dynamics can no longer be considered only an analysis tool, but it allows great advantages in all design stages, from conceptual up to detailed design level.},

Regarding serious/commercial applications, UAVs have been considered in the literature, especially as mobile sensing/actuation platforms (i.e., as a delivery platform for an increasingly wide range of sensors and actuators). With regard to timely, cost-effective and very rich data acquisition, both, NEC Research as well as TNO are pursuing investigations into the use of UAVs and swarms of UAVs for scenarios where high-resolution requirements, prohibiting environments or tight time constraints render traditional approaches ineffective. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of safety and security-focused application areas that we identified as main targets for industrial and commercial projects, especially in the context of intelligent autonomous systems and autonomous/semi-autonomously operating swarms. We discuss a number of challenges related to the deployment of UAVs in general and to their deployment within the identified application areas in particular. As such, this article is meant to serve as a review and overview of the literature and the state-of-the-art, but also to offer an outlook over our possible (near-term) future work and the challenges that we will face there.},

@techreport{A348Duke1994,
abstract = {The Derivation and Definition of a Linear Model program, LINEAR, provides the user with a powerful and flexible tool for the linearization of aircraft aerodynamic models. LINEAR was developed to provide a standard, documented, and verified tool to derive linear models for aircraft stability analysis and control law design. Linear system models define the aircraft system in the neighborhood of an analysis point and are determined by the linearization of the nonlinear equations defining vehicle dynamics and sensors. LINEAR numerically determines a linear system model using nonlinear equations of motion and a user supplied linear or nonlinear aerodynamic model. The nonlinear equations of motion used are six-degree-of-freedom equations with stationary atmosphere and flat, nonrotating earth assumptions. LINEAR is capable of extracting both linearized engine effects, such as net thrust, torque, and gyroscopic effects and including these effects in the linear system model. The point at which this linear model is defined is determined either by completely specifying the state and control variables, or by specifying an analysis point on a trajectory and directing the program to determine the control variables and the remaining state variables. The system model determined by LINEAR consists of matrices for both the state and observation equations. The program has been designed to provide easy selection of state, control, and observation variables to be used in a particular model. Thus, the order of the system model is completely under user control. Further, the program provides the flexibility of allowing alternate formulations of both the state and observation equations. Data describing the aircraft and the test case is input to the program through a terminal or formatted data files. All data can be modified interactively from case to case. The aerodynamic model can be defined in two ways: a set of nondimensional stability and control derivatives for the flight point of interest, or a full non-linear aerodynamic model as used in simulations. LINEAR is written in FORTRAN and has been implemented on a DEC VAX computer operating under VMS with a virtual memory requirement of approximately 296K of 8 bit bytes. Both an interactive and batch version are included. LINEAR was developed in 1988.},

abstract = {The development of a new generation of flying supersonic vehicles is a complex endeavor. Among the challenges, aeroelastic effects are known to be critical at high-speed flight. However, aeroelastic effects can also impact handling qualities and control during low-speed, high angle-of-attack maneuvers associated with the initial climb and final descent, further subject to gust disturbances. This paper explores the integration and application of a low-speed aeroelastic-flight dynamics model for simulating supersonic aircraft at high angles of attack using the University of Michigan's High-Speed Vehicle (UM/HSV) framework. The developed approach enables modeling the dominant vortex phenomenon at large angles of attack and capturing unsteady effects while accounting for flexibility effects. The full baseline supersonic aircraft model (SCALOS) is used to support the investigation aiming to enable future parametric investigations and generation of optimization constraints and sensitivities while providing adequate dynamic characteristics and handling qualities for such aircraft during climbing and descent maneuvers.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and implementation of a partitioned-based, multiphysics, multi-fidelity simulation framework for flexible hypersonic vehicles. This simulation framework will enable the study of the dominant physics needed for the generation of control-oriented models and will provide a reference model for flight control evaluation. A partitioned-based solution is employed to approach the problem of modeling a flexible hypersonic vehicle by dividing the vehicle into discrete regions within which unique combinations of physical processes are relevant. The dominant physics of each region are then modeled locally and information is exchanged across region interfaces at predetermined time intervals as the vehicle simulation is marched forward in time. The highly coupled physical processes within each region are modeled using an array of variable fidelity reduced order models. The partition solution implementation is compared to a monolithic solution through trim and time simulation of a sample hypersonic vehicle geometry. Trim results of rigid and flexible vehicle models show good matching between the partitioned and monolithic solutions for Mach 6, 26 km altitude, steady level flight. Time simulations at the same flight conditions also show good qualitative matching between the solutions, but a mismatch in effective mass distribution allows the monolithic vehicle model to have a slightly faster control response to a commanded elevon deflection. The partitioned solution code architecture is then extended to the characterization of flutter for a hypersonic lifting surface, showing a significant reduction of flutter Mach number as a function of flight time.},

Determination of dynamic stability derivative data at low-speed takeoff and landing conditions using both experimental and computational methods are shown for supersonic configuration features that are common on low sonic boom aircraft. These include trades on nose length, wing planform, nacelle location, horizontal tail location and canard on/off. Experimental methods use the Boeing Flow Visualization Water Tunnel (FVWT) with a 6-component, submersible balance, together with a state-of-the-art data acquisition and motion control system. Dynamic stability derivative coefficients are determined from forced oscillation testing using the Single-point Method. Comparisons between numerical methods and the experimental data are shown, using both Boeing Computational Fluid Dynamics (BCFD) Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS). Experimental results are also compared with vortex lattice methods. Results show the accuracy and effectiveness of forced oscillation testing of a small-scale model in a low-cost water tunnel. Reynolds number insensitivity is observed in the water tunnel and computational results due to the vortex dominated features of the water tunnel and supersonic configuration.},

The course emphasizes team work, communication skills, leadership, initiative, and innovation. It runs with tight budget and schedule constraints which the students must meet. Each year a new design challenge is pursued leading to new and unique research UAVs. The program leverages the University's own wind tunnel labs, local flight test locations, and the availability of experienced mentors.

A longitudinal flight dynamics model is considered for which a set of rejectable disturbances is defined based on the values of three proposed barrier functionals. The problem of finding an admissible control input is then converted into a discrete nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) by defining an objective function based on an augmented discretized nonlinear dynamics that takes into account the disturbance models. It uses the Kreisselheimer-Steinhauser aggregation function to enable the application of gradient-based optimization methods. As an illustration, such an approach is applied to three different configurations of a supersonic business jet in the landing flight phase and under gust and turbulence disturbances.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of a Pilot-Induced Oscillation (PIO) and human pilot control characterization study performed using flight data collected with a Remotely Controlled (R/C) unmanned research aircraft. The study was carried out on the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Several existing Category 1 and Category 2 PIO criteria developed for manned aircraft are first surveyed and their effectiveness for predicting the PIO susceptibility for the R/C unmanned aircraft is evaluated using several flight experiments. It was found that the Bandwidth/Pitch rate overshoot and open loop onset point (OLOP) criteria prediction results matched flight test observations. However, other criteria failed to provide accurate prediction results. To further characterize the human pilot control behavior during these experiments, a quasi-linear pilot model is used. The parameters of the pilot model estimated using data obtained from flight tests are then used to obtain information about the stability of the Pilot Vehicle System (PVS) for Category 1 PIOs occurred during straight and level flights. The batch estimation technique used to estimate the parameters of the quasi-linear pilot model failed to completely capture the compatibility nature of the human pilot. The estimation results however provided valuable insights into the frequency characteristics of the human pilot commands. Additionally, stability analysis of the Category 2 PIOs for elevator actuator rate limiting is carried out using simulations and the results are compared with actual flight results.},

abstract = {Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) represent a disruptive technology for aviation within the United States and worldwide. Efforts have been made to develop regulations, policies, and guidance materials to minimize their impact while maintaining an equivalent or sufficient level of safety. A key challenge is that there is no one-size fits all model for UAS. Moreover, there is a variety of UAS operations proposed and ongoing where the traditional file-and-fly model is insufficient. The classification and categorization of UAS and their operations plays a key role in their integration into the National Airspace System (NAS). Current approaches, e.g. the FAA's Small UAS Aviation Rulemaking Committee, follow traditional schemes regarding size and weight of the aircraft, the airspace in which they fly, and line-of-sight (LOS) versus beyond LOS operations. An alternative approach must be considered. At Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a team of researchers is addressing this problem as part of NASA's UAS NAS Integration program. A survey of literature regarding UAS systems, UAS operations, and NextGen technologies impacting UAS operations was performed. Key differentiating parameters were analyzed using Qualify Function Deployment's House of Quality to determine the parameters having the greatest impact on safety and NAS integration. From the analysis, an expert system has been developed to map UAS system characteristics (e.g. weight, autonomy, redundancy, etc.) to operational requirements (e.g. airspace, LOS vs. BLOS, operator requirements, maximum distance to landing site, etc.). Likewise, the expert system can map a proposed UAS operation/mission description to UAS system requirements. This paper will present this research. Several straw-man test examples will be reviewed to highlight the performance of the system under realistic UAS system and operational configurations. Lessons learned and future work will be discussed to move toward a tool to assist regulators.},

Thus any design synthesis must embody margins of safety commensurate with appropriate levels of risk related to social and economic consequence. The formulation of rules for design against wind involves the distillation of theory and results of experimental research and their simplification into safe workable tools for use in day to day practice.

abstract = {An increasing number of unmanned air vehicle (UAV) systems are being developed for use by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The adequate design and development of UAV platforms is crucial to future fleet operations. Flying qualities standards and criteria are currently deficient for UAVs and rely heavily on manned air vehicle standards and guidance. UAV specific missions, tasking, and payload requirements warrant development of new standards and criteria. Inadequate flying qualities specifications for UAVs may lead to reduced operational effectiveness, high loss rates, increased development cost and delays, and unnecessary design requirements. Typical guidance used in developing UAV platform system specifications for flying qualities has been MIL-F-8785, MIL-HDBK-1797, MILHDBK- 516, and ADS-33-PRF. These documents, developed as manned specifications, are correlated to pilot comfort and abilities, and have not been updated to address UAV specific needs and requirements. Current UAV specifications do not take into account sensor and payload mission requirements, and changes in basic flying qualities criteria that would allow more flexibility to the UAV designer without compromising airworthiness or mission performance. For example, traditional stall warning devices that ensure safe margin for pilots could be replaced with requirements for sensors and software that recognize and recover from upset conditions when they occur. Modifications to the existing manned flying qualities specifications go well beyond removing requirements for stick force gradients, but delve into the basic stability and control requirements of the airborne system itself. A UAV design should be aided, not hampered, by the more than 100 years of manned aviation history, to reach its full potential for mission performance. This paper briefly assesses the contents of the various fixed wing flying qualities specifications, identifies certain deficiencies with respect to UAVs, and proposes the development of new flying qualities criteria, specifications, and design standards specific to UAV platforms. Additionally, this paper identifies key research areas for the future.},

In spite of this effort, insuffcient resources have been devoted to developing meaningful and appropriate ying qualities criteria and requirements for unmanned aircraft. The failure to employ ying qualities criteria and requirements tailored to unmanned aircraft has resulted in high costs for equipment (due to mishaps), manpower, and development time. This article addresses the need for establishing a ying qualities standard for unmanned aircraft, and proposes that a mission-based standard provides the most exibility as aircraft designs and missions continue to proliferate. A fundamental requirement for such a standard is a database of subjective and objective ying qualities assessments upon which requirements can be based. In addition, research is required to answer questions related to appropriate mission task elements, ying qualities parameters, and levels of autonomy.},

abstract = {In today's military, unmanned systems are highly desired by combatant commanders (COCOMs) for their versatility and persistence. By performing tasks such as surveillance; signals intelligence (SIGINT); precision target designation; mine detection; and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) reconnaissance, unmanned systems have made key contributions to the Global War on Terror (GWOT). As of October 2008, coalition unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) (exclusive of hand-launched systems) have flown almost 500,000 flight hours in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have conducted over 30,000 missions, detecting and/or neutralizing over 15,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and unmanned maritime systems (UMSs) have provided security to ports. In response to the Warfighter demand, the Department has continued to invest aggressively in developing unmanned systems and technologies. That investment has seen unmanned systems transformed from being primarily remote-operated, single-mission platforms into increasingly autonomous, multi-mission systems. The fielding of increasingly sophisticated reconnaissance, targeting, and weapons delivery technology has not only allowed unmanned systems to participate in shortening the "sensor to shooter" kill chain, but it has also allowed them to complete the chain by delivering precision weapons on target. This edition of the Unmanned Systems Roadmap attempts to translate the benefit of these systems and technologies into the resultant combat capability by mapping specific unmanned systems to their contributions to Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) such as Battlespace Awareness, Force Application, Force Support, and Logistics.},

abstract = {This paper is about the design and analysis of two different rocket nozzle configurations. First configuration is without any fillets and curved surfaces and second configuration is with fillets and curved surfaces. Second configuration is used since stress concentration will be more at the corners if we don't have an optimized geometry having suitable fillets at appropriate places. Radiuses of fillets are chosen by previous studies conducted by academicians and design scientists for optimized configurations which give less overall induced stress values and hence more life. Initial configuration and Optimized configuration were drawn in ANSYS Mechanical APDL 14.5 and coupled element Quad 8 node 223 was selected for analysis. Material selected was Ti6Al4V (Grade 5). Quadrilateral mapped meshing was done and suitable boundary conditions were applied with the help of AXIMER 1.0 software. Different plots were obtained for Degrees of Freedom solution, Stress, Thermal Flux, Thermal Gradient and Total Thermal and Mechanical Strains for the two configurations. The degrees of freedom solution is calculated for all active degrees of freedom in the model, which are determined by the union of all degrees of freedom labels associated with all the active element types. It can be controlled and in this case, it would give the total number of degrees of freedom in every element of the model. Compared the two configurations and explained why the second configuration is better than the first.},

The aerodynamic analysis and sonic boom prediction are investigated by a number of conceptual-level numerical approaches. The panel method PANAIR is integrated to perform automated aerodynamic analysis. The drag coefficient is corrected by the Harris wave drag formula and form factor method. For sonic boom prediction, the near-field pressure is predicted through the Whitham F-function method. The F-function is decomposed to the F-function due to volume and the F-function due to lift to investigate the separate effect on sonic boom. The propagation method for the near-field signature in a stratified windy atmosphere is the waveform parameter method. In this research, using the methods described and publically available data on the concepts, the supersonic drag elements and sonic boom signature due to volume distribution and lift distribution are analysed. Based on the analysis, low-boom and low-drag design principles are identified.},

abstract = {A multidisciplinary design optimization methodology to directly minimize the ground level noise generated by a supersonic aircraft's sonic boom is presented. A gradient-based optimizer is coupled with a Cartesian Euler flow solver and an atmospheric propagation tool to forge a unique design capability. Adjoint formulations for both the flow solver and propagation tool are also coupled to provide sensitivities in an efficient manner. The design method is demonstrated on the X-59 Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator by optimizing control surface deflections to improve ground-level noise while maintaining trimmed cruise flight. Two noise minimization examples and a noise maximization are presented. All optimized designs result in measurable improvement in the ground-level noise objective. Extensive surveys of the design space confirm that the optimization method is effective in finding a local optimum. Moreover, repeated application of the method with varying initial design points also demonstrates the robustness of the method.},

abstract = {Supersonic flight for commercial aviation is gaining a renewed interest, especially for business aviation, which demands the reduction of flight times for transcontinental routes. So far, the promise of civil supersonic flight has only been afforded by the Concorde and Tupolev T-144 aircraft. However, little or nothing can be found about the aerodynamics of these aeroshapes, the knowledge of which is extremely interesting to obtain before the development of the next-generation high-speed aircraft. Therefore, the present research effort aimed at filling in the lack of data on a Concorde-like aeroshape by focusing on evaluating the aerodynamics of a complete aircraft configuration under low-speed conditions, close to those of the approach and landing phase. In this framework, the present paper focuses on the CFD study of the longitudinal aerodynamics of a Concorde-like, tailless, delta-ogee wing seamlessly integrated onto a Sears–Haack body fuselage, suitable for civil transportation. The drag polar at a Mach number equal to 0.24 at a 30 m altitude was computed for a wide range of angles of attack (0∘,60∘), with a steady RANS simulation to provide the feedback of the aerodynamic behaviour post breakdown, useful for a preliminary design. The vortex-lift contribution to the aerodynamic coefficients was accounted for in the longitudinal flight condition. The results were in agreement with the analytical theory of the delta-wing. Flowfield sensitivity to the angle of attack at near-stall and post-stall flight attitudes confirmed the literature results. Furthermore, the longitudinal static stability was addressed. The CFD simulation also evidenced a static instability condition arising for 15∘≤$\alpha$≤20∘ due to vortex breakdown, which was accounted for.},

abstract = {This study focuses on high-$\alpha$ flight maneuverability enhancement of a fighter-bomber aircraft for air combat superiority using thrust-vectoring control. Two basic air superiority maneuvers are studied as test cases, which are the Cobra maneuver with longitudinal motion and the Herbst maneuver with both longitudinal and lateral motions. The necessary mathematical models are built to describe the nonlinear 6-degree-of-freedom flight dynamics, the nonlinear aerodynamics, the engine, and the thrust-vectoring paddles of the aircraft. High-$\alpha$ aerodynamics of the aircraft is studied and the integrated Bihrle-Weissmann chart is plotted to determine the stall effected regions. The method employed to control the aircraft is based on feedback linearization with nonlinear dynamic inversion. Both of the test case maneuvers are simulated with two control modes using aerodynamic control only and thrust-vectoring control only. Then the performances of these control modes are compared. This study demonstrates that an additional thrust-vectoring control system integrated to the conventional aerodynamic flight control system of a fighter aircraft turns out to be highly effective in increasing its high-$\alpha$ maneuvering capability.

A range of cases are investigated, including a zero-pressure gradient flat plate, a NACA0012 airfoil at varying angles of attack, a DSMA661 airfoil, a NASA High-Lift Common Research Model, and a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) standard model (JSM) high-lift aircraft model. The final three cases were computed as part of the third AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop. For all of these, the same mesh and turbulence model is used to benchmark against the commercial CFD code STAR–CCM+. The paper shows that OpenFOAM using the Spalart–Allmaras model matches the lift and drag coefficient within 3\% of the commercial code for all the test cases simulated. For the JSM high-lift aircraft for which experimental data is available, both codes show good agreement at prestall angles of attack but fail to capture the location of separation at poststall angles, even though the global lift appears to be well predicted. Although OpenFOAM demonstrated comparable accuracy to a range of CFD codes for these aforementioned test cases, further work is required to improve the robustness and stability of OpenFOAM for these types of flows.},

The three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear aircraft model with elevator as control input is established using the appropriate aerodynamic data from wind tunnel test. The model also considers the landing gears, flaps and speed brakes. Elevator is used to control the angle of attack by means of pitch attitude and throttle controls the speed. The feedback linearization control technique guarantees good tracking performance with respect to a given glideslope trajectory. An exponential trajectory is employed during the flare, which needs a tighter control and hence requires both the altitude and sink rate for the feedback purpose. The elevator dynamics and the engine dynamics are modelled for the simulation purpose. The controllers are tuned considering the "ground effect" encountered during landing, which was mathematically modelled. Nonlinear simulation under measurement noises and external disturbances are included in this study. Simulation results show the importance of designing the controller considering the ground effect.},

In the current research effort, several important aerodynamic parameters which influence the roll characteristics of a fielded kinetic energy projectile (M735) have been predicted using CFD techniques. These parameters include the roll producing moment (at zero spin rate), the roll damping moment, and the equilibrium spin rate, defined as the spin rate for which the net rolling moment is zero.

abstract = {The coupling of the longitudinal and lateral stability modes of an aeroplane is considered in two cases: (i) weak coupling, when the changes in the frequency and damping of the phugoid, short period, dutch roll, and helical modes are small, i.e., the square of the deviation is negligible compared to the square of the uncoupled value; (ii) strong coupling, when the coupled values may differ significantly from the uncoupled values. This allows a comparison of three values for the frequency and damping of each mode: (i) exact, i.e., fully coupled; (ii) with the approximation of weak coupling; (iii) with the assumption of decoupling. The comparison of these three values allows an assessment of the importance of coupling effects. The method is applied to two flying wing designs, concerning all modes in a total of eighteen flight conditions. It turns out that lateral-longitudinal coupling is small in all cases, and thus classical handling qualities criteria can be applied. The handling qualities are considered for all modes, namely the phugoid, short period, dutch roll, spiral, and roll modes. Additional focus is given to the pitch axis, considering the control anticipation parameter (CAP). The latter relates to the two kinds of manouever points, where damping vanishes, that are calculated for minimum speed, take-off, and initial and final cruise conditions. The conclusion compares two flying wings designs (the “long narrow” and “short wide” fuselage concepts) not only from the point of view of flight stability, but also from other viewpoints.},

abstract = {Aircraft directional stability and control are related to vertical tail design. The safety, performance, and flight qualities of an aircraft also depend on a correct empennage sizing. Specifically, the vertical tail is responsible for the aircraft yaw stability and control. If these characteristics are not well balanced, the entire aircraft design may fail. Stability and control are often evaluated, especially in the preliminary design phase, with semi-empirical methods, which are based on the results of experimental investigations performed in the past decades, and occasionally are merged with data provided by theoretical assumptions. This paper reviews the standard semi-empirical methods usually applied in the estimation of airplane directional stability derivatives in preliminary design, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches that were developed from wind tunnel tests performed mainly on fighter airplane configurations of the first decades of the past century, and discussing their applicability on current transport aircraft configurations. Recent investigations made by the authors have shown the limit of these methods, proving the existence of aerodynamic interference effects in sideslip conditions which are not adequately considered in classical formulations. The article continues with a concise review of the numerical methods for aerodynamics and their applicability in aircraft design, highlighting how Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers are well-suited to attain reliable results in attached flow conditions, with reasonable computational times. From the results of RANS simulations on a modular model of a representative regional turboprop airplane layout, the authors have developed a modern method to evaluate the vertical tail and fuselage contributions to aircraft directional stability. The investigation on the modular model has permitted an effective analysis of the aerodynamic interference effects by moving, changing, and expanding the available airplane components. Wind tunnel tests over a wide range of airplane configurations have been used to validate the numerical approach. The comparison between the proposed method and the standard semi-empirical methods available in literature proves the reliability of the innovative approach, according to the available experimental data collected in the wind tunnel test campaign.},

abstract = {A brief overview of a cooperative NASA/Boeing research effort, Strake Technology Research Application to Transport Aircraft (STRATA), intended to explore the potential of applying forebody strake technology to transport aircraft configurations for directional stability and control at low angles of attack, is presented. As an initial step in the STRATA program, an exploratory wind-tunnel investigation of the effect of fixed forebody strakes on the directional stability and control characteristics of a generic transport configuration was conducted in the NASA Langley 12- Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel. Results of parametric variations in strake chord and span, as well as the effect of strake incidence, are presented. The use of strakes for yaw control is also discussed. Results emphasize the importance of forebody/fuselage crossflow in influencing strake effectiveness. Strake effectiveness is also seen to be directly related to its span, but less sensitive to chord; a very short-chord strake with sufficient span can have a significant effect.},

abstract = {There is a significant difference in the operational capabilities of large aircraftvs relatively small aircraft. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect the flying qualities of large aircraft to be significantly different from those of small aircraft. This paper attempts to point out a few areas where it has been recognized that the conventional flying qualities criteria - especially for the military - did not account for some significant differences in aircraft size. Specific areas that are discussed are: the short period frequency in the longitudinal mode; the time to bank in the lateral mode; and the permissible time delay for all axes. Some changes in military Opcriteria which have been made and their potential influence in aircraft design are discussed. An example of state of the art changes in flight controls for an older large - though not very large by present sizes - aircraft and its flying qualities in light of new criteria is also discussed.},

	abstract = {This book discusses state estimation and control procedures for a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The authors consider the use of robust adaptive Kalman filter algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over the optimal Kalman filter in the context of the difficult and varied environments in which UAVs may be employed. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) and data fusion for UAV air-data systems are also investigated, and control algorithms, including the classical, optimal, and fuzzy controllers, are given for the UAV. The performance of different control methods is investigated and the results compared. State Estimation and Control of Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles covers all the important issues for designing a guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system of a low-cost UAV. It proposes significant new approaches that can be exploited by GNC system designers in the future and also reviews the current literature. The state estimation, control and FDI methods are illustrated by examples and MATLAB{\textregistered} simulations. State Estimation and Control of Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles will be of interest to both researchers in academia and professional engineers in the aerospace industry. Graduate students may also find it useful, and some sections are suitable for an undergraduate readership.

The aircraft of interest is a research uninhabited aerial vehicle (R-UAV), a 1/16th scaled model of a concept supersonic business jet. Evaluation of stability and control characteristics is based on a linear time-invariant state-space small-perturbations approach. Low-speed wind tunnel results together with unsteady aerodynamic panel method analysis are the basis for the aerodynamic stability derivatives used. The main goal of this work is to study the effects on stability and controllability of reduction in size or complete elimination of tail surfaces, with particular emphasis on the vertical tail.},

@mastersthesis{D08Gryte2015,
	abstract = {Motivated by the limited landing space on board a ship, this thesis investigates the landing of the Skywalker X8 fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a net. Further motivated by the way birds abruptly, and equally elegantly, reduce their velocity when landing on a perch or the branch of a tree, a perched landing strategy utilizing the increased drag experienced for large angles of attack is used to minimize the velocity at impact with the net. This is accomplished by expressing landing as an optimal control problem, taking advantage of a nonlinear model of the X8 that is valid for high angles of attack. At this stage, the optimal control problem is only concerned with the three longitudinal degreesof- freedom. It is solved in an open source optimization framework, using a nonlinear interior point method. Further, a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that can control the X8 throughout the landing is developed. At the heart of the optimal control problem lies a linear model, blended with a flat plate model to increase its validity for high angles of attack in lift, drag and pitch moment. The linear model is developed using an easy-to-use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling software. In addition a six degrees-of-freedom software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulator is developed for future use in testing of hardware-near implementations of the controller, and to allow for validation of the model through pilot testing. Comparison of six different landing scenarios yield a wide range of landing velocities, depending on the constraints of the scenario. Simulations with the developed NMPC show that the same performance is achievable through control of the X8 under minor environmental disturbances. From this it is concluded that the perched landing strategy will lead to a considerable reduction in terminal absolute velocity, compared to a low angle of attack approach. It is found to be advantageous to start from a low altitude, landing into an elevated net. However, whether an equally large reduction is possible in practice depends on the capabilities of the real-time implementation and the validity of the model, particularly the propeller model, the pitching moment and drag coefficients. Finally it depends on how the lateral degrees-of-freedom are affected by the high angle of attack flight.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {A number of challenges in the development and application of flying qualities criteria for modern aircraft are addressed in this dissertation. The history of flying qualities is traced from its origins to modern day techniques as applied to piloted aircraft. Included in this historical review is the case that was made for the development of flying qualities criteria in the 1940's and 1950's when piloted aircraft became prevalent in the United States military. It is then argued that UAVs today are in the same context historically as piloted aircraft when flying qualities criteria were first developed. To aid in development of a flying qualities criterion for UAVs, a relevant classification system for UAVs. Two longitudinal flying qualities criteria are developed for application to autonomous UAVs. These criteria center on mission performance of the integrated aircraft and sensor system. The first criterion is based on a sensor platform's ability to reject aircraft disturbances in pitch attitude. The second criterion makes use of energy methods to create a metric to quantify the transmission of turbulence to the sensor platform. These criteria are evaluated with airframe models of different classes of air vehicles using the CASTLE 6 DOF simulation. Another topic in flying qualities is the evaluation of nonlinear control systems in piloted aircraft. A Special characters omitted.] adaptive controller was implemented and tested in a motion based, piloted flight simulator. This is the first time that the Special characters omitted.] controller has been evaluated for piloted handling qualities. Results showed that the adaptive controller was able to recover good flying qualities from a degraded aircraft. The final topic addresses a less direct, but extremely important challenge for flying qualities research and education: a capstone course in flight mechanics teaching flight test techniques and featuring a motion based flight simulator was implemented and evaluated. The course used a mixture of problem based learning and role based learning to create an environment where students could explore key flight mechanics concepts. Evaluation of the course's effectiveness to promote the understanding of key flight mechanics concepts is presented.},
